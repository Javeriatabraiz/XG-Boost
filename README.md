# XG-Boost

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to use XGBoost for predictive modeling. The notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It serves as a practical guide for understanding how to apply the XGBoost algorithm to your own projects.

**Overview**

The project uses XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting framework, to build a predictive model. The notebook walks you through each step of the machine learning workflow:

Data preparation and feature engineering.
Model training and hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation of the model’s performance.
Visualization of the results.
This resource is ideal for those looking to leverage XGBoost for both classification and regression tasks in a straightforward, easy-to-follow manner.

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Required Python libraries: xgboost, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

**Usage**

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
